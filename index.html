      <p>My name is Adam Miner, and I am an aspiring web developer with emphasis on JavaScript and Node.js.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have come down a rather long path to get to this point, but every step along the way has been worth it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After a few years of college-hopping, I finally was introduced to the wide world of web development by way of the Galvanize program.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While I didn't graduate from Galvanize, it instilled in me a determination to follow my dream of being a full-stack web developer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Feel free to visit my <a href="./portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for a look at my past projects, and get a glimpse of things to come!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Also, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">get in touch</a> with me at any time.</p>
